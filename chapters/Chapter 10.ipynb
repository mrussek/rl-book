    "Now we investigate the _control_ problem as opposed to the _prediction_ problem for the case where the learned value function is approximate. As such, we now consider a parameterized action-value function $\\hat{q}(s, a; \\mathbf{w}) \\approx q_*(s, a)$. We only consider the on-policy case. We will implement _semi-gradient Sarsa_. The continuing case must be reformulated in order to ensure the problem remains well posed. This new formulation will rely on an \"average-reward\" ordering of policies, and we must use differential value functions and TD errors."

Alternatively, one could use a sample average of the observed rewards for $\\bar{R}$. That would initially adapt rapidly but in the long run would also adapt slowly. As the policy slowly changed, $\\bar{R}$ would also change; the potential for such long-term nonstationarity makes sample-average methods ill-suited.
